<p>
I created Ideation Networks because I wanted to bring open source solutions to people who needed them. I wanted to save people from proprietary vendor lock in and promote interoperability and openness.
</p>
        <p>I choose open source because I believe in Freedom. Open source gives us adaptability, interoperability, and options. It helps us prepare for the future.
</p><p>
Proprietary systems and data formats create lock-in where vendors build their business models around selling you licenses to access your own systems and data.
</p><p>
We do things differently. We build our business models on providing value. </p>
<p>We like to work on projects that do good. Our clients like to work with us because of the insight we offer, our methodical reasoning, and ability to generate novel solutions. </p>
